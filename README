= Kagemusha - a library of testing mock-objects

http://github.com/nayutaya/kagemusha/

== DESCRIPTION:

Kagemusha is a library of helper functions
for testing Ruby scripts.  It helps you generating
scoped mock-objects which overrides behavior of
the class restricted in given blocks, without
tainting a global area.

For example, if you override Date.today when you write
something about dates, then the code will taint global
areas to no purpose.

If you use Kagemusha, the test code will override
behavior of the class restricted in given block.

Example:
  require "kagemusha"

  musha = Kagemusha.new(Time)
  musha.defs(:now) { self.local(2000, 1, 1) }
  musha.def(:to_s) { self.strftime("%Y-%m-%d") } 

  musha.swap {
    p Time.now      #=> Sat Jan 01 00:00:00 +0900 2000
    p Time.now.to_s #=> "2000-01-01"
  }

Also, it has default useful mock-objects set Date, Time,
rand, and so on.

Example:
  require "kagemusha/date"

  musha = Kagemusha::Date.at(2000, 1, 1)
  musha.swap {
    p Date.today.to_s #=> "2000-01-01"
  }
